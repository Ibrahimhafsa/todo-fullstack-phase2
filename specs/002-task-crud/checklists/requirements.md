# Specification Quality Checklist: Task Management (CRUD + Ownership)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-17
**Feature**: [specs/002-task-crud/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/sp.plan`.

**Validation Summary**:
- 6 user stories covering all CRUD operations plus toggle completion
- 25 functional requirements organized by category
- 10 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 7 edge cases identified
- 6 assumptions documented
- Constitution alignment: Spec-2 principles (VII-X) properly reflected
